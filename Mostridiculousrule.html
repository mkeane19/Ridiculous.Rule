<h1>Most Ridiculous Rule</h1>

<p>The most ridiculous rule I've encountered in school was when our skirts and shorts in middle school couldn't be worn. Ever. We had to go around in the buff. Welcome to cab calloway. show some respect and tkae off your pants. </p>
<h2> Excessive Rule Enforcing </h2>
<p2> First of all, while it's unbelievably strange to even have a rule that specific in the first place, there was no reason for my principal to be carrying around double A batteries at all times for the sole purpose of holding them up to measure skirt length. This caused so much unnecessary worry among my classmates and it easily could have been avoided. </p2>
