<h1>Most Ridiculous Rule</h1>

<p>The most ridiculous rule I've encountered in school was when our skirts and shorts in middle school couldn't be higher than the size of two double A batteries above our knees. To enforce this rule, our principal walked around the halls carrying double A batteries and holding them up to everybody's knees.</p>
<h2> Excessive Rule Enforcing </h2>
<p2> First of all, while it's unbelievably strange to even have a rule that specific in the first place, there was no reason for my principal to be carrying around double A batteries at all times for the sole purpose of holding them up to measure skirt length. This caused so much unnecessary worry among my classmates and it easily could have been avoided. </p2>
